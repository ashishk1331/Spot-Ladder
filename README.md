![The prototypal image of the app.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugekontrast/Spot-Ladder/main/images/Spot%20ladder-page-001.jpg)

### Usage
* Install node packages
> npm i

* Run the app locally
> npm start

### Problem !!!
Spotify doesn't provide blends information from its API yet. So, the app doesn't showcase its core functionality. While it works fine for the rest.

### Tech used
* HTML, CSS and JS
* Node along Express

### Features
* Login with just your spotify profile url
* Share your Spot-ladder profile

### Things to add
[  ] Blend Information <br />
[  ] Spotify based login <br />
[  ] Invitation generator to make a blend <br />

### Things I got to learn about
* IIFE - Immediately Invoked Functional Expression
* Functional Programming
* SPA( Single Page Application)
* State management using Local Storage
