![The prototypal image of the app.]()

### Usage
''' npm start '''

### Problem !!!
Spotify doesn't provide blends information from its API yet. So, the app doesn't showcase its core functionality. While it works fine for the rest.

### Tech used
* HTML, CSS and JS
* Node along Express

### Features
* Login with just your spotify profile url
* Share your Spot-ladder profile

### Things to add

### Things I got to learn about

* Functional Programming
* SPA( Single Page Application)
